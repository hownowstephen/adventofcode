Write a program that takes a -file flag then reads an engine schematic from the specified file and adds up all the part numbers.

The engine schematic (your puzzle input) consists of a visual representation of the engine.

The schematic consists of lines containing numbers and symbols. Any number that is adjacent to a symbol in the matrix (including diagonally adjacent) is considered a part number. Period characters (.) do not count as symbols.

Here is an example engine schematic:

467..114..
...*......
..35..633.
......#...
617*......
.....+.58.
..592.....
......755.
...$.*....
.664.598..

In this schematic, two numbers are not part numbers because they are not adjacent to a symbol: 114 (top right) and 58 (middle right). Every other number is adjacent to a symbol and so is a part number; their sum is 4361.

If two numbers are adjacent to each other, they should be considered as one singular numeric value, so a line containing .23$.. would yield a part number of 23.

When writing a function to extract a part number, make sure to look at preceding characters in the line as well as following ones to capture the full number

The program should print out the sum of all the part numbers in the schematic.
