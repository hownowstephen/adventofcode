write a program that accepts a file flag as input, and iterates over the file. For each line in this file, we want to find the first and the last numeric value in the string.

to help with debugging, please print your progress using the format 

$originalLine -> first:$firstInteger last:$lastInteger concat:$concatenatedIntegers

A numeric value may be a single digit 1-9, or multiple characters containing a word representing the corresponding digit, eg. one, two, three, etc. The line may contain strings that are not numeric and the program must be able to find substrings that are.

The program should find the first and last occurrence in the string of a numeric value as defined above. The best way to find the values is using a regexp that explicitly looks for each possible value.

After you have found the matching values, you MUST ensure they are converted to a valid integer string. For example, if the match is "one" it should be converted to "1". You should do this by creating a mapping from the english string value to the integer string. Ensure there is a mapping for all single digit integers.

Once you have only integer strings: if there are two or more numeric values in the line, concatenate the first and last values together. Otherwise take only the first value.Convert the resulting string to an integer.

Take the sum of each integer generated this way and print it out at the end of the run.
